The time has come!

Keep in mind this download link expires after some time, so if you want to download Multisite Ultimate after the link expires, you would need to do it by signing into your [Freemius account](https://help.wpultimo.com/article/282-how-can-i-access-my-account-page-for-the-first-time) and downloading it from there.

Remember to also have your **license key** ready, since you will need it to activate Multisite Ultimate.

### Where to find your license key

You can find your License key on the email you received after the purchase and inside your Freemius account. Just click on the Licenses tab and your license will be shown there.
