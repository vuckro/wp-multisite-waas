  * **Can I use WP Multisite WaaS to limit the number of posts a user can create on his/her site?**

Yes. With WP Multisite WaaS you can establish post quotas for **every available post type** on your network. You can also limit the number of users the admin can invite, the **amount of disk space,** and much more.

  * **Does WP Multisite WaaS support Site Templates?**

Yes. With WP Multisite WaaS you can create as many Site Templates as you want. Site Templates are not themes, they are normal sites on your network. You can activate plugins, themes, and customize that Site Template in any way you want. If a user selects that template, his or her site will be created as a copy of that template, with all the customizations in place.

You can also set a particular template for a plan. By doing that, every user that signs up on that plan will have his or her site created as a duplicate of that Site Template.

  * **Does WP Multisite WaaS integrate with WooCommerce?**

Yes!

If you want your network users to have WooCommerce available for them, allowing them to set up stores, that is possible using WP Multisite WaaS. You can even limit the number of products your clients will be able to create on each plan tier.

In terms of subscription payments for WP Multisite WaaS, you can use the [WP Multisite WaaS: WooCommerce Integration Add-on](https://wpultimo.com/addons/wp-ultimo-woocommerce/) to allow your WP Multisite WaaS clients to pay using WooCommerce gateways on your main site. In that way, you can tap into the huge library of payment gateways developed for WooCommerce and use them to bill your WP Multisite WaaS clients.

  * **Is there a way to migrate subscriptions from WPMUDEV Pro Sites?**

Yes, WP Multisite WaaS now offers you [a helpful tool to get you to migrate](https://wpultimo.com/addons/wp-ultimo-pro-sites-migrator/) your Pro Sites network.

  * **Why is the “Allowed Plugins” tab empty on my Plan Edit Page?**

WP Multisite WaaS only lets you allow or deny access to plugins not network-activated on your network. When a plugin is network-activated, by its very nature, it will be loaded by default on every site of your network.

If you do not see any plugins listed on the “Allowed Plugins” tab, check if the desired plugin is network-active or not.

  * **Can I use my own Pricing Table design?**

Yes. Since version 1.4.0, WP Multisite WaaS supports template overrides.

  * **Does WP Multisite WaaS work with WP Engine?**

Yes. WP Multisite WaaS was always supported by WP Engine, but getting domain mapping to work required manual extra steps from the admin (adding the domain to the WP Engine panel). **This is no longer the case since version 1.6.0.** WP Multisite WaaS integrates directly with the WP Engine API and domains get added to the panel automatically after mapping.

  * **Which hosting provider do you recommend?**

WP Multisite WaaS should work with any hosting provider. The only difference is that some hosting company like Closte, Serverpilot, WPMUDEV, WP Engine, Cloudways, Gridpane and [Runcloud.io](http://Runcloud.io) has a tighter integration for domain mapping capabilities so they work out of the box. For other hostings. you may need to set up domain mapping manually.
