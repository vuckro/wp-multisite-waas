# How to create Must-Use Plugins (mu-plugins)

WordPress has a feature that allows you to load custom functionality called "Must-Use Plugins", or "mu-plugins" for short.

These special mu-plugins are loaded before all other regular plugins, and they can’t be deactivated. In a multisite network, the code in these mu-plugins will be loaded on all the sites in your installation.

1\. Use FTP or SSH to access the filesystem of your WordPress install.

2\. Inside the wp-content directory of your WordPress install, create a new directory named: mu-plugins.

3\. Create a new PHP file on your computer named wu-snippet.php using Notepad or any code editor.

4\. Place the WP Multisite WaaS code snippet you got GitHub repository into the file and save it. You can also add this code on top of the code snippet to label your mu plugin.
