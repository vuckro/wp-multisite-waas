# Multisite Ultimate Hooks and filters

Multisite Ultimate is made up of a whole load of functions and database queries. It has hooks and filters that will allow you to modify or add new code to existing functions.

We created a list of these hooks and filters as a reference to help advanced users further customize their network. You can access the list from Github by clicking the link below.
