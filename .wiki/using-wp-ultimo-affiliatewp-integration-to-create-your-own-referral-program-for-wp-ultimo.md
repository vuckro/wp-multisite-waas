# Using Multisite Ultimate: AffiliateWP Integration to create your own referral program for Multisite Ultimate

[AffiliateWP](https://affiliatewp.com/) has become the go-to solution when building an affiliate program for your online business. Multisite Ultimate: AffiliateWP is the bridge that will enable you to build the same thing for your premium network.

## Getting Started

First of all, you **need to have** [**AffiliateWP**](https://affiliatewp.com/) **active**! You won't be able to use our add-on if you don't have **the plugin that integrates with it**. In case you don’t plan to let your clients use it on their sites as well, AffiliateWP should be active only on your main site.

Also, you’ll need both **Multisite Ultimate** and **Multisite Ultimate: AffiliateWP** **activated** **network-wide**.

## Adding Multisite Ultimate as an AffiliateWP Integration

On your main site, head to Affiliates Settings, and on the Integrations tab, check Multisite Ultimate. This will tell [AffiliateWP](https://affiliatewp.com/) to start tracking visits and conversions from the Multisite Ultimate sign-up flow.

That’s pretty much all that it takes. Visits coming from referral links will be tracked and when that user later makes his first payment, the conversion will be created and a commission will be put aside to the affiliate responsible for the conversion.

Only the first payment received from the newly created user will be tracked, though. To enable recurring referral payments, you’ll need the [AffiliateWP Recurring Referrals Add-on](https://affiliatewp.com/add-ons/pro/recurring-referrals/)

## Enabling Recurring Referrals

After installing the [AffiliateWP Recurring Referrals Add-on](https://affiliatewp.com/add-ons/pro/recurring-referrals/), head to Affiliates Settings Recurring Referrals tab, and enable the use of recurring referrals.

_As simple as it gets: Enable Recurring Referrals and you’re all set!_

Again, that’s all it takes!

Now, every time a new payment is received on a referred account, the affiliate responsible will get its own cut automatically!
