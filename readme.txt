**"Failed opening required [...]/vendor/autoload_packages.php"**

Solution: Deactivate and remove any older versions of WP Ultimo or Multisite Ultimate before activating the new version.

**"Class 'WP_Ultimo\Database\Sites\Site_Query' not found"**

This error can occur if the plugin's autoloader isn't properly loading all the necessary classes.

Solution: Use the pre-packaged release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/superdav42/wp-multisite-waas/releases) which includes all required files.
