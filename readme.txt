Version 2.0.11 - Released on 2022-04-09

* Important
  * Fixed: Plugin & Theme Limitations not being loaded, leading to plugins not being hidden, or auto-activated after registration;
  * Fixed: Site duplicator now deals with plugins that have custom database tables with foreign key constraints - for example, Bookly;
  * Fixed: Incompatibility between Avada and mapped domains;
  * Fixed: Incompatibility between Avada and template previewer;
  * Fixed: Incompatibility with FluentCRM breaking the registration flow;
  * Fixed: Domain mapping issues on previous build;
  * Fixed: Payments pending on trial plans;
  * Fixed: Products with wrong duration after checkout;
  * Fixed: Sites created in double in some circumstances - specially when using Stripe & Stripe Checkout;
  * Added: A completely re-designed and re-written SSO module, built to work in a higher level of abstraction to support all current and future possible use cases; It deals natively with:
    * Security: there's a token exchange protocol that verifies both sides of the auth process;
    * Cross-scheme Auth: When we are not able to access remote cookies due to different schemes being used, we force a regular redirect flow to authenticate the customer regardless;
    * Admin Panel Access: Prevents the auth_redirect function from sending the request to wp-login.php before SSO has a chance to kick in;
    * Auth for different Domain Options: SSO no longer focuses on mapped domains only. It gets triggered anytime there's a mismatch between the target domain and the main network domain. This allows it to work with sites that were registered using different domain options offered on checkout;
    * Loading Screen: the new SSO offers a setting that adds a loading overlay when SSO is being performed on the front-end;
    * Support to Incognito Mode: most browsers prevent cookies from being set from third-parties, nowadays. Our SSO detects incognito mode and forces a full redirect, instead of trying to authenticate directly with the verify code;
  * Added: Placeholders on Thank You page snippet code editor, to pass values to conversion snippets;
  * Added: Country classes with state and city lists to allow for more granular control over how taxes apply territorially, as well as to guarantee that valid billing address info is entered during checkout. At the moment, the following countries are supported: US, GB, BR, FR, RU, DE, NE, ES, CA, CN, ZA (this list was devised based on our current customer base, new countries can be added as requested).
  * Added: REST API field requirements and descriptions are now compiled and saved as static files at build time. This is done because we use reflection on PHPDocBlocks to generate the documentation of the fields, and comments might not be available if op_cache is enabled on production, causing the REST API to break;
  * Improvement: Add CNAME records from Cloudflare to the DNS checking results, in addition to A and AAAA;
  * Improvement: Updated DNS lib to prevent memory leaks when checking for DNS;
  * Improvement: Adds fatal error catcher when the DNS resolver runs into a memory limit error, although this no longer happens due to the above fix;
  * Improvement: Using CSS grid to lay fields on the checkout field instead of flex/float. This cleaned up the fields markup a good bit and makes it more customizable. By default, the checkout form is a two-column grid, with fields spanning the two columns;
  * Improvement: Better responsiveness on the checkout form, resulting from the use of CSS grid;
  * Improvement: Replaced the old hacky implementation of the Site URL prefix and suffix blocks (disabled inputs) with a proper flex block with a prefix and suffix element;
  * Improvement: Checkout field blocks use less opinionated HTML tags (div, instead of p) to maintain semantic value and escape the default spacing CSS rules applied to paragraphs;
