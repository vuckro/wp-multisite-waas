## 🚀 Contributing

We welcome contributions to Multisite Ultimate! Here's how you can contribute effectively:

### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Run `npm install` and `composer install` to set up dependencies
4. Make your changes
5. Before committing, run `npm run build` to:
   - Generate translation POT files
   - Minify CSS and JS assets
   - Process and optimize other assets
6. **Important:** Update both README.md and readme.txt files when making changes that affect:
   - Version numbers
   - Required WordPress/PHP versions
   - Feature additions or changes
   - Installation instructions
   - Documentation
   - Changelog entries
7. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
8. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
9. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting pull requests, please:

1. Include a clear description of the changes and their purpose
2. Reference any related issues using GitHub's issue linking syntax (#123)
3. Ensure your code follows the existing style and conventions
4. Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes if applicable
5. Make sure all tests pass (if available)
6. Update documentation as needed
7. Verify that both README.md and readme.txt are updated and synchronized

### Release Process

Releases are automated using GitHub Actions workflows that trigger when a version tag is pushed.

**Tagging Convention:** To trigger a new release build, push a tag following the semantic versioning format:

```bash
git tag v2.3.5  # For example, for version 2.3.5
git push origin v2.3.5
```

The tag must begin with "v" followed by the version number (v*.*.\*)

This will automatically:

1. Build the plugin (run `npm run build`)
2. Create a properly packaged ZIP file
3. Create a GitHub release with the ZIP attached

When preparing for a release:

1. Update the version number in the main plugin file and readme.txt
2. Update the changelog in readme.txt
3. Ensure README.md and readme.txt are synchronized with the latest information
4. Create and push the appropriate version tag
